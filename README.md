# Blog with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) 🔥

This mini blog project was made following the lessons of the Next.js documentation.

I was able to learn a lot from Next.js by following its own documentation. Its biggest features without a doubt such as Pre-rendering (SSG, SSR), Data Fetching, and also the most used method getStaticProps, in addition to getStaticPaths in Dynamic Routes.
